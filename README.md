This is an attempt to develop a statistic app for central tendency measurements.
The user will manually enter the observations and create a sample.
The app will caclculate the Arithmetic mean, median and mode.
The above three measurement are different due to the outliers effects. therefore the user will have all three and decide which one to use after checking the accuracy.
ROADMAP: write the mode functionality, design a UI, and host the app on GitHub.
